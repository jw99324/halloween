<h2>The Halloween Store</h2>

<h3>For the little Goblin in all of us!</h3>


<h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h2>

<p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

<h2>Product categories</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href= "slides/products/props" title="Props"> Props </a></li>
    <li><a href="slides/products/costumes" title = "Costumes"> Costumes</a></li> 
    <li><a href = "slides/products/specialeffects" title = "Special Effects"> Special Effects</a></li>
    <li><a href = "slides/products/masks" title = "Masks"> Masks</a></li>

    <h2>My guarantee</h2>

<p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it for a full refund. <strong>No questions asked!</strong></p>
